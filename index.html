    <h2>Designing and building handwired split mechanical keyboard</h2>
    <p>
      As a computer science student a keyboard is my everyday tool. For a long time, I used a cheap chinese brand 65% mechanical keyboard. 
      I enjoyed the feeling when typing on it (it had knock-off Cherry MX brown switches), as opposed to my previous very old membrane keyboard.

      Soon I discovered, there is a big community focused on building custom keyboards, but the prices of some branded parts seemed really crazy to me. <br><br>
      Later, I found out, there are people who design and make the keyboards by themselves, according to their needs, and it can also be done on a healthy budget.
      With access to 3d printer and my passion to design and make things, the idea of building my own keyboard was born.

    <h2>Video upscaling (super-resolution) using neural networks</h2>
    <p>
      In this blogpost, I will present my implementation of neural network that can upscale resolution for video given on input based on Generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture.
      <br><br>
      The first step was a realisation, that this problem could be reduced to upscaling single frame-by-frame images from the video and then connecting them at the end. 
      The process of upscaling images is generally called <i>Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)</i>, which is nowadays a wide topic that a lot of researchers are interested in 
      and has a broad range of applications. There are some traditional techniques (Bicubic interpolation), 
      that solve this problem, but the results are often blurry and can be enhanced by the use of machine learning techniques.
